# OneOfTheCapstoneProjects

This is one of the capstone projects created for the purpose of the HyperionDev bootcamp. It is called "inventory".

This Python program is an example of object orientated programing which uses classes. It allows you to become a store manager rosponsible for managing the warehouse wtih sport shoes. The catalog of shoes has the following attributes: 
- Country
- Code 
- Product
- Cost 
- Quantity

The program allows you to:
- Search products by code.
- Determine the product with the lowest quantity and restock it.
- Determine the product with the highest quantity.
- Calculate the total value of each stock item. 

In order to use this program you need to have Python installed on your computer with itegrated development environment (for example: Visual Studio Code). The package comes in two files. One is a python type "inventory.py" which runs the program. The other one is an "inventory.txt", which serves as a database for all the shoes in the warehouse. After running the program, you will be presented with a amenu selection where you can perform the above mentioned allowed functions.
